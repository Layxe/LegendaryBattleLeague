- Get the 4 most played champions of the player and the mastery score on them.
- Every champion has constant stats: For example the attack, defense and ability power.
    -> These values can be every number between 1 and 10
This number is also being multiplied by the (mastery score divided by 200k + 1)
  -> This is how the calculation looks like:
    totalAD += championX-AD * ( championX-masteryScore / 200000 + 1 )
    -> That means if someone has a mastery score of 200k on a champion the stats of this
       champion are going to be multiplied by 2
So the total amount of attack power etc. will be calculated from the 4 champions.

At the end these stats are going to be multiplied / divided to add some balance.
attackPoints  = totalAD*3
healthPoints  = totalDEF / 4 * 100
abilityPoints = totalAP * 4
